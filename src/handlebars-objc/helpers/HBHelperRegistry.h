/**
 HBHelperRegistry instances are objects holding a set of helpers available to templates.
 They are the actual objects used by [HBExecutionContext] instances to store helpers.
 
 You generally do not use a registry directly but use the corresponding shorcut methods on [HBExecutionContext]
 
 Helper registries implement the objective-C keyed subscripting API though, meaning that you can read and write helpers using subscripting operators. For instance : 
 
 HBExecutionContext* e = [[HBExecutionContext] new] autorelease]; 
 HBHelper* h = ...;
 e.helpers[@"my_helper"] = h;
